    "\n",
    "Pair programming is an agile software development technique in which two programmers work together at one workstation. One, the driver, writes code while the other, the observer or navigator, reviews each line of code as it is typed in. The two programmers switch roles frequently.\n",
    "\n",
    "This methodolgy is quite known in the computer science realm, and we want to try and see how well it would work in our little class room. Hopefully we would all benefit from this, by closing the gap between more experienced coders and less so we could move forward to more advanced topics! Additionally, there is always the benefit of having a friend when all hell breaks loose (or the code just would not work..)\n",
    "\n",
